I am a PhD Student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. My research uses data-driven predictive modeling to explore personality and mental health in the context of online social networks.

Currently, I am pursuing a 5-course [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization) focused on data visualization, functional programming, and machine learning.
